<p>Working on this project taught me all I know about creating a responsive website purely by code. It is also a showcase of my work. Credit for teaching me goes to the best teacher ever - <a href="http://travisneilson.com/#about" target="_blank">mr. Travis Neilson</a>. My thanks also goes to <a href="https://github.com/DevTips" target="_blank">DevTips community on Github.</a></p>
